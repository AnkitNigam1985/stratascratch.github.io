# QB Stats Exercises

This dataset gives information on every NFL game and every passer over 5000 regular season games from 1996 to 2016. 
The excel files supply us with over ten thousand quarterbacksâ€™ names over 21 years and specify the success of each one. 
Each year contains every single game from that season and gives statistics like completions, attempts, yards, and an overall 
rating for the quarterback for that game.
