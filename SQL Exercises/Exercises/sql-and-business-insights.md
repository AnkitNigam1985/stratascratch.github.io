# SQL and Business Insights

## Instructions 
- Log-in to your Strata Scratch account. 
- All tables used in this exercise are taken from the datasets schema. Make sure you select this schema on the SQL editor settings. 
- Try to answer the following questions by writing the appropriate SQL query on the editor. 
- For most of the questions, you will need to produce a chart that shows a list of dimensions (e.g., music artists) and counts (e.g., the number of grammies they’ve won).
- For each topic, there are also one to two open ended questions (e.g., who is the best athlete to be drafted into the NFL?). You’ll need to analyze the dataset, create your own metrics, and provide a convincing argument.
