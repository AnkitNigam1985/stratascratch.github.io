# QB Stats Exercise Solutions

This dataset gives information on every NFL game and every passer over 5000 regular season games from 1996 to 2016. 
The excel files supply us with over ten thousand quarterbacksâ€™ names over 21 years and specify the success of each one. 
Each year contains every single game from that season and gives statistics like completions, attempts, yards, and an overall 
rating for the quarterback for that game.

The exercises below uses the `datasets.qbstats_1996_2016` table.

### Question 1
Who are the quarterbacks who have achieved high average game points during their careers?

*Solution:*

In our query, we begin by selecting the qb column and solving the average of the game points. To know which quarterback has the highest game points, we group the qb results and sort the data in descending order.
```sql
SELECT 
    qb, 
    AVG(game_points) AS avg_points
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
GROUP BY qb
ORDER BY avg_points DESC
```

### Question 2
Who were the top 10 quaterbacks judged by their rating (the `rate` column)?

*Solution:*

To answer the question, we can select the qb and rate columns from the table. We add a condition where rate is not equal to `NULL` so that we can skip rows with `NULL` values. The results are then grouped and sorted so that we can determine the top 10 results.
```sql  
SELECT 
    qb,
    rate
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE rate is NOT NULL
GROUP BY qb, rate
ORDER BY rate DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Question 3
Who were the top 10 quarterbacks with the highest game points in 2016?

*Solution:*

We can determine the top 10 quarterbacks by selecting the qb and game points columns. To display only the results for the year 2016, we add a conditional statement where `year = 2016`. We can determine the top 10 by simply sorting the results in descending order.
```sql
SELECT
    qb, 
    game_points
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE year = 2016
ORDER BY game_points DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Question 4
Where did the quarterbacks perform better in 2016, at home or away?

*Solution:*

Using pivot table making techniques we can determine the max number of points each quarterback won during 2016. We construct two new columns `home_points` and `away_points` and looking at them we get the answer we are looking for. To construct them we `GROUP BY` over `qb` and filter for `year = 2016`. How would you use these two new columns to generate a third column which holds the answer in format 'home better' or 'away better'?

```sql
SELECT 
    qb,
   
    MAX(CASE
        WHEN home_away = 'home' THEN game_points
        ELSE NULL
    END) AS home_points,
    
    MAX(CASE
        WHEN home_away = 'away' THEN game_points
        ELSE NULL
    END) AS away_points
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE year = 2016
GROUP BY qb
```

### Question 5
What is the average number of game points won for each year?

*Solution:*

To answer the question, we simply solve for the average game points and sort the data by year in descending order. This will allow us to easily view the results starting from the latest year.
```sql
SELECT 
    year,
    AVG(game_points) AS average_points
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year DESC
```

### Question 6
Who throws the longest in 2016?

*Solution:*

Our query starts by selecting the qb and lg which contains the longest throw data from the dataset. Since we are only interested in the results for the year 2016, we add a conditional statement where `year = 2016`. We want to group the results by qb and `longest_throw`, and rank the results in descending order. The top result is the answer. 
```sql
SELECT
    qb, 
    lg AS longest_throw
FROM 
    datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE 
    year = 2016
GROUP BY 
    qb,
    longest_throw
ORDER BY longest_throw DESC
```

### Question 7
Who had the most touchdowns (TD) in 2016?

*Solution:*

We can answer the question by counting the touchdowns `td` and add the `year = 2016` on the conditional statement. We group and sort the data in descending order to determine the top results.
```sql
SELECT 
    qb, 
    COUNT(td) AS times
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE year = 2016
GROUP BY qb
ORDER BY times DESC
```

### Question 8
Which quarterback played the most games in 2016?

*Solution:*

The question can be answered by first counting `qb` or quarterback rating from the dataset. We add the conditional statement `WHERE year = 2016`, group the data by `qb` and sort the data to know the top results.
```sql
SELECT 
    qb, 
    COUNT(qb) AS most_appearances
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE year = 2016 
GROUP BY qb
ORDER BY most_appearances DESC
```

### Question 9
Which quarterback had the least amount of interceptions in 2016?

*Solution:*

To know which quarterback has the least amount of interceptions, we must first count the number of interceptions `int` from the dataset. We add the `year = 2016` to filter the results, and group and sort the data in ascending order to know the results which have the least number of interceptions.
```sql
SELECT
    qb, 
    COUNT(int) AS interceptions
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE year = 2016
GROUP BY qb
ORDER BY interceptions ASC
```

### Question 10
Which quarterback has the most QB that tried to throw the ball in 2016?

*Solution:*

We can determine which quarterback has the most QB by counting the `att` from the table. To filter the results, a conditional statement where `year = 2016` is added. We can easily determine from the results which quarterback has the most QB that threw a ball by sorting the data in descending order.
```sql
SELECT 
    qb, 
    COUNT(att) as times
FROM datasets.qbstats_1996_2016
WHERE year = 2016
GROUP BY qb
ORDER BY times DESC
```
