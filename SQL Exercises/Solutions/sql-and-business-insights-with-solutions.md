# SQL and Business Insights *(with Solutions)*

## Instructions 
- Log-in to your Strata Scratch account. 
- All tables used in this exercise are taken from the datasets schema. Make sure you select this schema on the SQL editor settings. 
- Try to answer the following questions by writing the appropriate SQL query on the editor. 
- For most of the questions, you will need to produce a chart that shows a list of dimensions (e.g., music artists) and counts 
(e.g., the number of grammies theyâ€™ve won).
- For each topic, there are also one to two open-ended questions (e.g., who is the best athlete to be drafted into the NFL?). 
Youâ€™ll need to analyze the dataset, create your own metrics, and provide a convincing argument.
- This is the teacher version of the SQL and business insights exercise. The questions below are followed with the correct solution. 
Each topic includes one to two open-ended questions which could have numerous possible solutions, and one 
of these solutions is shown here. 

## Questions

### 1. Billboard Top 100

Dataset: `billboard_top_100_year_end`

- What were the top songs for the past 30 years?
- Which artists have had the most top 10 songs over the years? What were the songs?
- Which artists have been on the billboard top 100 the most in the past 10 years?

### 2. SF Crime

Dataset: `sf_crime_incidents_2014_01`

- What were the top crime categories in 2014? How many incidences per category?

*Solution:*

In our solution, we want to determine first the number of categories which can be attained through the `SELECT` statement. To get the results within the year 2014, we added the conditional statement `WHERE date>='2014-01-01' and date<='2014-12-31'`. Knowing the top crime categories can be easily viewed by grouping and sorting the results in descending order.
```sql
   SELECT
      category,
      count(category) as count
   FROM datasets.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
   WHERE date>='2014-01-01' and date<='2014-12-31'
   GROUP BY category
   ORDER BY count DESC
```

- What day of the week was there the most crime? Does crime incidence vary depending on the month? Depending on the time?

*Solution:*
```sql
   SELECT
      day_of_week,
      count(category) as count
   FROM datasets.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
   GROUP BY day_of_week
   ORDER BY count DESC
```

Based on the result, the day of the week with the highest crime is Friday.

- What districts had the most crime incidences?

*Solution:*
```sql
   SELECT
      pd_district,
      count(category) as count
   FROM datasets.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
   GROUP BY pd_district
   ORDER BY count DESC
```

Based on the result, the Southern District has the most crime incidences.

- Where is the most dangerous place in SF? What metrics would you use to convince me?

*Solution:*
```sql
   SELECT
      address,
      pd_district,
      count(category) as count
   FROM datasets.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
   GROUP BY address, pd_district
   ORDER BY count DESC
```

Based on the result, the most dangerous place in SF is at 800 Block of BRYANT ST.
