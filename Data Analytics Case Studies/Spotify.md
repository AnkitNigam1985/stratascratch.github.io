### Business Case

The Spotify marketing team is starting an advertising campaign. Their goal is to maximize the number of daily streams across all regions in the world. The only dataset they have is their worldwide daily song rankings which is a list of songs ranked by the number of user streams and organized by regions. As the manager of the marketing team, how should the team focus their advertising resources and what should they do to maximize the number of daily streams?

A few things to think about:

- Who are the top artists/groups?
- What percentage of streams come from the top artists contribute?
- How long do artists typically stay in the top 10?
- Which artists should the marketing team invest in?
- Should the marketing team invest in artists that do not get a lot of streams?
- How much overlap are there between regions?
- How many songs do artists have in the top 100?
