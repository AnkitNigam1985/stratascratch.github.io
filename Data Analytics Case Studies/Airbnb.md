## Airbnb Case Study

#### Accessing The Data Resources
- Dataset 1 can be found under `datasets.airbnb_contacts`
- Dataset 2 can be found under `datasets.airbnb_searches`
- Access the data at www.stratascratch.com
- You can use SQL on Strata Scratch to answer the questions or connect to the datasets and answer the questions using other tools like python
- You can now run Jupyter notebooks on Google CoLab so thereâ€™s no software installation needed. Use this [introductory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tHxAbgbxM60VUIrVQW508EwB1b3wFk5g) as a template to start the analytics case.


### Business Case

- There are two tables: airbnb_contacts and airbnb_searches. Explore the columns the datasets and merge the two on an appropriate key. Then display the first 5 rows of the merged dataset.

- What is the average number of searches across users?

- What does the distribution of the number of nights guests are searching for look like?

- What is the breakdown of the number of messages exchanged between guest and host?

- How many unique searchers are there in the dataset? And how many different properties are there?

- How many times does a user perform a search on average? 

- Is there a difference between the number of times a user searches and successfully books vs the number of times a user search does not book?

- What does the converstion funnel from a guest contacting a host to a guest booking the property look like? Are there any problems with the funnel? Compare the number of users that contacted the host, had the host respond, accepted the reservation, and booked the reservation
