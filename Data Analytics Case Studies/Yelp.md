### Business Case

- Investigate the data and see if anything needs cleaning.  Hint: Check the unique values and value_counts for the stars column.

- Clean the data by removing the reviews with '?' for stars rating

- Replace the stars values that are text with integers

- How many 5 star reviews does Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles have?

- What is Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles star review breakdown? (i.e., tell me how many 5 star reviews for Lo-Lo's, 4 star, 3 star, etc) *Hint: try using value_counts()

- What's the most number of cool votes a review received?

- What was the business' name and review_text for the business that received the most cool number of votes

- Which business has the most reviews? (hint: use .value_counts())
