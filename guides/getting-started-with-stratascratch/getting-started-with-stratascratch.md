# Getting Started with Strata Scratch
Data analytical skills are important whether you are aspiring to become a data scientist or simply a student or a professional specializing a different field but somehow needs to deal with a large chunk of data. This page is the ideal place to start learning the basics about database programming and how to manipulate a massive amount of data using our platform. The steps below will first introduce you to SQL Lab and the basic functions you need to know to start using our platform effectively.

## The SQL Editor
Log in to your account to see your homepage as shown on the image below. The homepage consists of your account information, settings, tabs, and a number of dropdown menus located on the top toolbar. We will begin by exploring the functionalities of the SQL Lab menu which consists of all the basic tools you need to start your database.

The SQL editor is a powerful tool that allows you to type SQL commands, build and run queries, create and edit your data, visualize results, and many others.

## Accessing Public and Private Datasets
If you are a new user, you will see an untitled query tab on the left side of the page. Below the tab are configuration options which allow you to choose a database and dataset. A public schema dataset is uploaded by default for your convenience. It is composed of public datasets which you can use as a reference. However, the schema is read-only so you cannot make any changes to it.

You also have access to your own dataset repository under your private schema username where you will have full privileges, such as reading or editing your datasets. Under your private schema, you are given the freedom to move data from other schemas or upload your own CSV file.

## Running the SQL Query

Next to the configuration sidebar is a workspace where you can type SQL queries. You can start with basic commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY. We will learn more about this in the next tutorial. For now, it is enough for you to familiarize the functionality of the SQL editor.
