## Create a Table Name
The first step for importing a CSV file is to provide a name for the table you will be creating. Type the name on the box provided next to the Table Name label. 

- Note that in the example below, we typed “sample_db” as the name of our table. It’s common practice to not include spaces, special symbols, and capital letters when naming your table.
